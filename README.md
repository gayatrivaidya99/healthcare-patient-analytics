#  Healthcare Patient Analytics Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of healthcare patient data to uncover patterns in hospital stays, costs, readmission rates, and outcomes. Using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Tableau for interactive visualization, it aims to support healthcare administrators in identifying areas for cost optimization and improving patient care quality.

The dataset includes 50,000 anonymized patient records with features like:
Age, Gender, Department, Diagnosis
Length of Stay, Total Cost, Severity
Readmission Status, Outcomes, Comorbidities

### The project walks through:

## Step 1: Data Exploration in Python
Summary statistics, null checks, and value distributions
Histograms, scatterplots, and outcome comparisons

## Step 2: Predictive Modeling (Optional)
Simple classification model to predict readmission likelihood

## Step 3: Tableau Dashboard Creation
KPI cards (e.g., Total Patients, Avg Cost)
Department-wise insights
Cost vs Length of Stay scatterplot
Outcome and readmission drilldowns

Together, the analysis and dashboard provide a compelling, data-driven narrative around hospital performance and patient metrics.
